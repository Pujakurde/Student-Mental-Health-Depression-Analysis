# Student Depression Analysis and Interactive Dashboard

## Project Overview

Student mental health has become a critical concern influenced by academic pressure, lifestyle habits, and personal circumstances.
This project focuses on analyzing depression trends among students using structured data analysis and presenting insights through an interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Objectives

* Analyze patterns and factors associated with student depression
* Study the impact of academic pressure, sleep duration, and workload
* Identify high-risk student groups using interactive filtering
* Build a production-level dashboard for stakeholders and decision makers

---

## Tools and Technologies

* SQL – Data querying and aggregation
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
* Power BI – Interactive data visualization and dashboarding
* Power Query – Data transformation and preparation
* Git and GitHub – Version control and documentation

## Dashboard Description

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of student mental health indicators with interactive capabilities.

### Key Components

* KPI metrics including total students, depressed students, depression rate, and average CGPA
* Interactive slicers for age group, gender, degree, and city
* Visual analysis of depression by age group and gender
* Evaluation of academic pressure and sleep duration impact
* High-risk student table filtered to show only depressed students

---

## Key Insights

* Higher academic pressure is associated with increased depression levels
* Insufficient sleep duration shows a strong correlation with depression
* Certain age groups demonstrate higher vulnerability
* Academic and lifestyle factors significantly influence student mental health

---

## Data Preparation and Modeling

* Cleaned and standardized categorical values using Power Query
* Created age group categories for better analytical clarity
* Ensured correct data types for accurate aggregations
* Implemented reusable DAX measures for dynamic and slicer-driven analysis

---

## Use Cases

* Educational institutions monitoring student well-being
* Counselors and mental health professionals
* Academic administrators and policy planners

---

## Future Enhancements

* Drill-through analysis for detailed student profiles
* Bookmark-based storytelling within the dashboard
* Integration of predictive modeling for early risk identification
* Deployment through Power BI Service
