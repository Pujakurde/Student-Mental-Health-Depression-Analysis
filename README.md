# 🎓 Student Depression Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting depression among students using machine learning. By evaluating various factors such as academic performance, lifestyle, and social behavior, the model aims to identify students who may be at risk of depression, promoting early intervention and mental well-being.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict depression levels in students (e.g., low, moderate, high)
- Identify key factors influencing student mental health
- Create visual insights for understanding trends and patterns
- Promote awareness and data-driven support strategies

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized information such as:
- 📚 Academic performance  
- 💤 Sleep habits  
- 👥 Social activities  
- 🏡 Family background  
- 🧠 Mental health survey responses  
- 🏃 Lifestyle choices  

> Note: Dataset is either self-collected via Google Forms or sourced from open repositories like Kaggle.

   - Handling missing values  
   - Label encoding & normalization  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation matrix  
   - Distribution plots  
   - Feature importance  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine  
   - Naive Bayes  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision & Recall  
   - F1 Score  
   - Confusion Matrix
